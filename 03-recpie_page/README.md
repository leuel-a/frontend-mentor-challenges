### What I learned

This CSS code snippet demonstrates how to define variables and use them throughout the stylesheet. Let's break down some key takeaways:

- Custom properties: The code uses CSS variables (--clr-white, etc.) to store color values. This allows for easier maintainability and centralized control over the color scheme.
- Font Families: The code imports two fonts (Outfit and Young Serif) using the @font-face rule.
- Modular CSS: The code utilizes classes like .wrapper and .preparation--row to style specific sections of the layout.
- Responsive design principles: By setting max-width for the .wrapper class, the code ensures the content adapts to different screen sizes.
